                  Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but
                  these often differ from one language to another. This article
                  attempts to list the built-in data structures available in
                  JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to
                  build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons
                  with other languages are drawn. Dynamic typing JavaScript is a
                  loosely typed and dynamic language.
